                                    The year is 1985 and two men on opposite sides of the continent — one a rogue Egyptologist and sought-after book reviewer for the New York Times, the other a claims adjuster and amateur litterateur — agree on one thing: Charles Portis’ fourth book, Masters of Atlantis, is just not that funny.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Nearly twenty years later, these two men, John Anthony West and Lionel “Bud” Coup, were finally united through the magic of the Internet.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    They quickly realized they had much in common: a fondness for cedar wood, strong feelings for Egypt, a passion for Masonic lore, and nearly identical literary tastes. Their friendship blossomed and from this one of the great late-20th century literary correspondences was born.

                                    It is a very great honor then for the Bi-Decadal People’s Review to republish in its entirety, and for the first time since 1985, the book review that sparked the legend: John Anthony West’s controversial Pletho Pappus and the Doughboy (reprinted here with the permission of the author, who can be reached at jawsphinx@jawest.net)

                                    MASTERS OF ATLANTIS By Charles Portis. 248 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $15.95.

                                    CHARLES PORTIS’S fourth novel, “Masters of Atlantis,” which chronicles 60 years in the life of a secret society called the Gnomons, should be a rich source of comedy. The last century has seen a proliferation of sects, cults and secret societies of every imaginable sort – the natural, historically documented corollary to a civilization in the throes of disintegration. In this instance the process has been exacerbated by an original factor – the forces responsible for the debacle insist upon calling it progress, obscuring what would otherwise be self-evident.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Some of these societies have been predominantly metaphysical, philosophical and spiritual and have counted among their adherents renowned writers, artists, architects, mathematicians and even a few scientists. Others have been evangelical, messianic or contemplative. Still others have been pagan, orgiastic or satanic. Some have attracted millions of devotees and advertise in The National Enquirer; others keep underground. They have nothing in common beyond offering some kind of alternative to established institutions, and all of them were begun by extraordinary individuals. Some of these were crazy, some charlatans, some neither, but all were charismatic. You do not have to approve of Werner Erhard, or the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, or Aleister Crowley, Jim Jones or Charles Manson to understand their appeal, and on a different level altogether there are Rudolf Steiner, Jiddu Krishnamurti and G. I. Gurdjieff, among others. Yet all can be turned to comic ends; there is nothing human that cannot.

                                    Mr. Portis is best known for his second novel, ”True Grit,” one of those rare books to deserve the extravagant praise they elicited. ”True Grit” is virtuoso storytelling in that American tall-tale, Huck Finn vein. A preternaturally savvy adolescent country girl sets out to track down her father’s killer. As accomplices she enlists two mutually antagonistic, hard-bitten United States marshals. ”True Grit” is simultaneously high adventure and comic psychological drama as young Mattie Ross proceeds to make monkeys of the woman-hating marshals. It is a delectable, sure-footed book, with a headlong plot, vivid characters and writing so good and so original that you have to force yourself to stop to savor the comic twists and turns.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Mr. Portis followed that novel with ”The Dog of the South,” again based upon a quest. A young man sets out from Arkansas for Mexico on the trail of his runaway wife, her lover and his stolen Ford Torino (it’s the car he really wants back). Though well received, ”The Dog of the South” lacks the drive and purity of ”True Grit.” There are ominous, extended sojourns on the other side of that elusive line that separates being funny from trying to be funny.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Unfortunately, ”Masters of Atlantis” rarely veers to the right side of that line. For some unknown reason, Mr. Portis has chosen to ignore the rich and varied material offered by history.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    His Gnomons are a bland, hapless bunch corresponding to nothing specifically; they practice a vague, watered-down Masonry or Rosicrucianism, with a dash of theosophy and ”Ceremonial Magick” thrown in. They claim descent from the masters of sunken Atlantis. They count among their adepts Pythagoras, Cornelius Agrippa (a Renaissance magician and alchemist) and Cagliostro (the 18th-cen-tury alchemist and charlatan), and their master as the novel opens, at the end of World War I, is a shadowy character called Pletho Pappus (around that time there was a well-known occultist writing in Paris under the pen name Papus, which may be the source of the name).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It is Pletho’s decision to make public in encoded form the ancient mathematical, symbolic, geometric Gnomonic wisdom in a secret manuscript called the Codex Pappus. The manuscript falls into the hands of a recently discharged American doughboy, Lamar Jimmerson, who swiftly becomes an initiate charged with spreading Gnomonry to America. Here is the paragraph describing those rites: ”Lamar was embarrassed again. But Jack insisted that yes, Lamar was indeed worthy and must now prepare himself for acceptance into the brotherhood. Lamar did so. First came the Night of Figs, then the Dark Night of Utter Silence. On the third night, a wintry night, in Room 8 of the Hotel Davos, Lamar Jimmerson folded his arms across his chest and spoke to Jack the ancient words from Atlantis – Tell me, my friend, how is bread made? – and with much trembling became an Initiate in the Gnomon Society.”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This is limp stuff. There is nothing funny about the Night of Figs, nothing scary about the Dark Night of Utter Silence, no reason for Jimmerson to tremble, or for us to laugh. And there is nothing mysterious about how bread is made – at least not in this context. In ancient Egypt, in esoteric Christianity and elsewhere, the fermentation processes responsible for bread serve as metaphors for the transformation of the carnal into the spiritual. I T is hard to imagine that the author of ”True Grit” wrote the passage quoted above. But all Mr. Portis’s many talents have abandoned him here. Jimmerson is at best a torpid presence; his English counterpart, Sir Sydney Hen, a mincing, opportunistic baronet, is nastier but no more interesting; Jimmerson’s right-hand man, a chamber of commerce-style booster, Austin Popper, is equally flat. Only briefly does the old Charles Portis surface, in the dialogue of a wacky Rumanian self-styled professor and inventor, Cezar Golescu, a devotee of Mu (the legendary civilization preceding Atlantis in theosophical literature but originally proposed by a well-known zoologist, P. L. Sclater). For a few pages Golescu comes on like the great but eccentric Nikola Tesla as played by the Three Stooges, then he too disappears into the prevailing lassitude.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Mr. Portis has chosen to write about a subject that apparently does not interest him much; he doesn’t even despise it, and it is impossible for the reader (this reader, anyway) to care to follow the strained little ups and ungiddy downs of American Gnomonry. With luck, his next book will find Mr. Portis back where his heart is, in Arkansas. If he proves unable to repeat his ”True Grit” performance, that alone assures him a place in comic literature. As the ”I Ching” puts it: no blame.
