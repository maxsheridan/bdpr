                                    Saturday always reminds of Lionel because it was on Saturday that Lionel hosted his literary salons. Lionel’s wife, Leona, who is still limber as a wet duck, found this treasure in Lionel’s famous Wabash filing cabinet. She was kind enough to disinfect it and pass it along. Not a bad way to end the week! This will tie in nicely with the republishing of John Anthony West’s seminal Charles Portis review next week.
                                </p>

                                    I quote the letter in its entirety below. It is vintage Lionel. Enjoy.

                                    Dear Mr. Weste [sic],
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I have a feeling I may know you, although I cannot remember where we met. A long-time acquaintance brought it to my attention that you also write reviews for the N(ew)Y(ork) Times. When I say also, I mean other than your Egyptian activities. I hadn’t placed you there either, to tell the truth, but my acquaintance had — when I mentioned having met you. ‘Oh, it’s the guy that does the Egyptian things.’ Those were his exact words. I had some vague idea about your involvement in matters Egyptian but wouldn’t have gone so far as to put it that way. I am a little concerned about this. In any case, I noticed you are selling your house in NY. Good luck with that. I have always been a fan of cedarwood.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Why am I writing you out of the blue after all these years? There is a reason behind it. I have a friend — not the same fellow I told you about above — who was a stringer for the Cuero Record in the late 60s. He told me your roots were in NYC. I have some people out there, too: my ex-wife’s brother-in-law, a Hispanic gentleman. So this friend of mine told me that he thought it was a shame that many of the finest literary reviews, once they’ve gone the rounds, generally disappear from the public eye. When I checked into the matter myself, I found out that he was right on the money. At that point, it occurred to me that there might be something in contacting the authors of the better written pieces after a space of twenty years or so to let them know that their work hadn’t gone unnoticed — hence, the Bi-Decadal People’s Review. This is now what I do in my spare time.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Ironically, I have found that many of the reviews do not hold up over time. That is to say, I find many inconsistencies that are at odds with the general literary trends that developed in the years following their publication. In your case, I was amazed at how close to the mark you’d nailed that Portis fellow in your 1985 review, ‘Pletho Pappus and the Doughboy.’  Having Masonic leanings myself, I could not for the life of me fathom why something as bogus as the ‘Night of the Figs’ could have gotten a laugh out of anyone, or, as you remarked, how that nonsense about the bread could have figured in any plausible Masonic initiation, imaginary or otherwise. I would also add that many of the titles Jimmerson and his nemesis, Hen, claim for themselves do not exist. ‘Creeping bag weed’ did not yield any fruit either. If it exists, which I doubt personally, it has none of the properties typically associated with ‘alchemical vessels.’ Clearly, this was intended as a mockery of the whole alchemical doctrine.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Finally, something I don’t believe you commented on, is the figure of Dr. Golescu. While Portis would have you believe that Golescu’s interest in the esoteric sciences was an anomaly, this is obviously a misguided, if not racist, formulation of Romania’s involvement in matters Masonic. You would think Portis would have known about Princes Sturdza, Bibescu and Moruzi, if not about the Romanian Masonic epopee in Paris’ L’Athénée des Étrangers.
                                </p>

                                    So that is my story. I hope this may be of some use to you. I know that this is not what you would consider ‘fan mail’ per se, but I would imagine it is the closest thing to it in the book reviewing business. I have heard that many journalists, when they have accumulated a number of articles, frame the best of them and hang them in their studies. Possibly they do this to stimulate comments from visitors, though it is my belief that such an arrangement, as long as it is understated, is the ideal one for reflecting upon one’s life achievements. If you decide to do this with my letter, please indicate that I have been at least peripherally involved in the process.
